**URL**: https://run.gptengineer.app/projects/87522051-f93f-46f5-9fae-86e4912463ff/improve

**Description**: I would like to create an automation tool that would reach out to people on the platform Workaway that are a potential suitable match for us. The tool should also submit reminders to people that do not respond at first. 

The tool also requires to look into my profile on Workaway, grab all the available data and build messages based off that to send to suitable candidates taking into account their profile information, skills and availability to make the best and closest possible match.
